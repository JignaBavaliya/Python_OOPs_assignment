    "Access Modifiers (by convention): Python does not have explicit public, private, or protected keywords. Instead, it uses naming conventions to indicate intended access levels: \n",
    "Public Members: Attributes and methods without any special prefix are considered public and are directly accessible from outside the class.\n",
    "Protected Members (single underscore _): Attributes or methods prefixed with a single underscore (e.g., _protected_attribute) are conventionally treated as \"protected.\" This indicates to other developers that these members are intended for internal use within the class or its subclasses, though they are still technically accessible from outside.\n",
    "Private Members (double underscore __): Attributes or methods prefixed with a double underscore (e.g., __private_attribute) are conventionally treated as \"private.\" Python performs \"name mangling\" on these members, making them harder to access directly from outside the class (though not impossible, as direct access is still possible by knowing the mangled name). This convention strongly signals that these members are intended for internal class use only.\n",
    "Getters and Setters: To provide controlled access to \"private\" or \"protected\" attributes, getter and setter methods are commonly used.

    "Polymorphic Behavior: When you have a collection of objects that belong to different subclasses but share a common superclass, you can iterate through this collection and call a method that has been overridden in the subclasses.
